Website status: <strong>Complete</strong>

<strong>Mile-stone Project 1</strong>
-

The purpose of this website is to inform fans of the Monkees band of latest news
music and events for the band. there will also be a section where people can
contact the band to book them for events such as weddings, charity events, view
pictures and listen to some of there songs. There will also be a page for
information on the band members.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------


<strong>UX:</strong>
-

This website was designed to allow the user to view some songs from the Monkees
albums. It also allows users to view up coming events, band pictures and to
contact the Monkees to hire them. The website is a simple one and easy to
navigate allowing the user to easily find the content there after. In the bottom
of every page are links to there social media pages and there youtube page so
that users can find information that Is not on the website. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

<strong>Current features:</strong>
-

<strong>Wiki links</strong> 
- 
On the band page each picture and band member name links the the
members own wikipedia page. I have done this because it would be much easier to
do so than create web pages for each band member.

<strong>Social media links</strong> 
- 
I have included links to the Monkees facebook, youtube,
instagram and twitter pages for the users to find more content that is not
included in this website.

<strong>Contact page</strong> 
- 
The contact us page allows users to message the band to book them
for events. It requires the user to provide there name and e-mail address to
submit the message, otherwise they will be given a message telling them to fill
in the indicated sections. Currently this does not send a message as I have not
learned how to do this yet.

<strong>Layout:</strong>
-

for the desktop and tablet view I put inplace a notification banner at the top of the page.
this directs users to the contact us page to allow the user to message to the band.
I have also placed a music vedeo on the home page with an image that can't be seen on mobile.
Each band member's name and image on the band page is a link to there own 
wikipedia pages, I did this to save time as creating pages for each of them would
have taken too long for this project. Social media links can be easily found in the footer
with a link to there youtube page too.

<strong>Technology’s:</strong>
-

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><strong>HTML</strong></a> 
- 
This is the standard language for making websites.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"><strong>CSS</strong></a>
- 
In combanation with Bootstrap I used my own css file to give the website a personal touch.
This also allowed me to get the website to work properly on all devices.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"><strong>JavaScript</strong></a>
-
JavaScript was used to make the contact form. It requires the user to input there name,
e-mail and a message to submit anything. If anything is missing a prompt shows
the users what is missing.


<a href=”http://getbootstrap.com”><strong>Bootstrap</strong></a>
- 
I used Bootstrap to give the 
website a basic styling, suported with my own css file for a personal look.

<strong>Bug hunt:</strong>
-

I used the developers tools on Microsoft edge and discovered a few misplaced tags.
This has been fixed. On mobile and tablet the background image gets stretched, 
this will be fixed at a later date.

---

<strong>Deployment:</strong>
-

I chosen to deploy my website to Github due to its simple method for uploading whilst
you are still working on your projects. To upload to Github you first have to create 
a repository on github then enter the following commands onto the command window on cloud 9:


- git remote add origin git@github.com:Danhayes3008/repository-name.git
- git inital
- git add .
- git commit -m "update" .
- git push -u origin master


By doing this all the work on the website is backed up incase there is problems with 
the development side. It will allow me to recover a previously deployed file allowing me to
recover any information that was lost or incorrectly altered.

After researching the Monkees on Google i discovered from a
<a href="https://www.monkees.com/news?page=1">the Monkees</a>
website that a Christmas album has been released. No text was copied, but wanted
to give recognition to this website for the latest news on the band that i have
found. This also includes dates for Michael Nesmith and the First National Band
Redux, and a super deluxe edition album.

all events information has came from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/
TheMonkees/events/?ref=page_internal">The Monkees</a>
Facebook page. all rights to the content belong to Monkees. all images for the
events are for learning purposes, rights for entrance.jpg image belongs to trip
advisor, Keswick-Theater.jpg image belongs to facebook and the
count-basie-exteriornighttime1.jpg image belongs to
<a href="http://www.ronsunshine.com/event/frank-sinatra-centennial-birthday-bash
-at-the-count-basie-theatre/" target="_blank">Ron sunshine.</a>

Band members linked to there indevidual wikki links page. with information on the band page
added to make it look better than just having there name's and pictures.

<strong>Help:</strong>
-

Received help from Robin Zigmond on the slack general chat room in regards to an
error i was having with setting an image as a background. After sharing some of
my code and screen-shot of my file directory, he pointed out that i forgot to
add ../../ at front of the name for my image to be used.

<a href="https://github.com/Eventyret">Eventyret</a> provided some help fixing a
problem with my bootstrap elements. After a few minuets he pointed out i was 
using the wrong bootstrap version, and advised i cange it from the 4.4.0 version
to the 3.3.7 version.
